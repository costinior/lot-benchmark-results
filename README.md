# SHM on ROS

This repository contains supplementary material from the paper "Smart Pointers and Shared Memory Synchronisation for Efficient Inter-process Communication in ROS on an Autonomous Vehicle".

The full resolution pictures used throughout the paper can be found under "figures" folder, whilst the underlying raw data is stored under "data/core2" folder.

The configuration of each use case has been embedded into the name of the file, e.g. sub1_shm_1p1s_same_docker_1024x1024_pool0_Hz30_count2000.txt designates a test case where the SHM transport has been used to broadcast 2000 1MB images from one publisher to one subscriber at 30Hz without relying on memory pools.
